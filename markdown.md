Create a modern, dark-themed developer portfolio website using React, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. The design should include the following sections:

1. **Hero Section**:
   - A greeting heading like "Hi, I'm [Your Name] ðŸ‘‹"
   - A short bio with emojis and a profile image on the right
   - Clean, centered layout

2. **Work Experience**:
   - Show current and past roles with company names, positions, and dates
   - Use icons or initials for company logos

3. **Education**:
   - Display university name, degree, and years

4. **Skills Section**:
   - Show skill tags like HTML, CSS, JS, React, TypeScript, Git, Firebase, etc.
   - Use pill-style tags with nice spacing and hover effect

5. **Projects Section**:
   - Grid layout for 3-6 projects
   - Each project card includes:
     - Title
     - Short description
     - Tech stack used
     - Tags like "Website", "Full Stack", etc.
     - Live demo and GitHub buttons
     - Color-coded border to visually separate each card

6. **Responsive Design**:
   - Ensure it looks great on both desktop and mobile
   - Use Tailwind for spacing, shadows, rounded corners

7. **Footer with Pagination**:
   - Simple footer with icons for navigation or pagination like dots (â¦¿ â¦¾ â¦¾)

Use Tailwind for styling and make sure everything is accessible and clean. The tone of the portfolio should be friendly, modern, and professional.
